  Between all the other UI designs, the main difference is that the others' UI's are a lot simpler than mine. 
They all have their options on one menu, instead of my multiple menus. Some UI's have symbols to represent what each 
object does, others aren't so specific. It seems that I am the only one that included a settings.
  As for similarities, all the UI's seem to go with some sort of meter and arrow set up to indicate an increasing/decreasing
power/temperature level. All the UI's implement a simple button press to alternate on/off for things like defog or air cycle.
We all included ways to change temperature measurement as well.
