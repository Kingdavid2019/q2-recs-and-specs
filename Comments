Differences: One member has a multi-page UI. 

Similarities: Most of the members had a one screen UI with simiple buttons to do the task. The volume buttons seem to be similar because 2 members have slide up temperture and 
the other two have a (+)/(-) button to chnage temperature. To change temperature we all had a feature where we could click a button to change the unit of measure.

Differences:
  Between all the other UI designs, the main difference is that the others' UI's are a lot simpler than mine. 
They all have their options on one menu, instead of my multiple menus. Some UI's have symbols to represent what each 
object does, others aren't so specific. It seems that I am the only one that included a settings button to change multiple things.

Similarities:
  As for similarities, all the UI's seem to go with some sort of meter and arrow set up to indicate an increasing/decreasing
power/temperature level. All the UI's implement a simple button press to alternate on/off for things like defog or air cycle.
We all included ways to change temperature measurement as well.
