The design for my UI is pretty simple

For options such as whether air is internally recycled and the windshield de-fog is on/off, it's just a simple button push to switch between on and off. For fan speed, vent positioning, and temerature control, there are buttons on the sides of each option to increase or decrease said option incrementally until desired position or temperature is reached.

The customers that could use this UI is not limitted to country as I have also implemented another button that switches the dispayed temperature between showing it in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

For different driving conditions I could implement more utilities in the UI such as seat warmer control and possibly a wider range of temperature options.

Lastly, for customers with disabilities I could include a couple of more features but that depends on what said disabilities are.
